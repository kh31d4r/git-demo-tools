* Git Demo Tools
  Git Demo Tools is a suite of tools useful for teaching and demoing
  [[https://git-scm.com/][git]].

** Live log
   Live log is started with the =git livelog= command, and will start
   a continuously updating git tree with enough information to make it
   useful, but still sparse enough to fit on a screen next to a shell.

   The command takes two parameters, the maximum number of entries
   (lines) to show, and the update interval in seconds. The default
   number of lines is 20, and the default update interval is 1 second.


* Installation
  To install the tools, clone this repository and add the bin
  directory to your =$PATH=.
